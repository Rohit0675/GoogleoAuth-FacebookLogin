I have successfully integrated Google OAuth and Facebook Login in my React application. Users can now securely log in using their Google and Facebook accounts. After authentication, the application retrieves the user's information and displays it in encoded form in the browser console.
I used the google-auth2 library, which provides the GoogleOAuthProvider and GoogleLogin component. By passing the appropriate client ID obtained from the Google Developers Console, the application establishes a connection with Google's OAuth service.
I used the LoginSocialFacebook component provided by the reactjs-social-login library. By passing the appropriate Facebook appId obtained from the Facebook Developers Console, the application establishes a secure connection with Facebook for login purposes.
For testing purposes, I generated an authentication token using Postman.
